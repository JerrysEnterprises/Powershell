Run the following commands to fix

	1. Checks the version - 5.1 only has SSl and TSL 1.0

		Get-Host | Select-Object Version

	2. Checks the security protocols that are being used

		[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol

	3. Sets strong cryptography on 64 bit .net framework

		Set-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\.NetFramework\v4.0.30319' -Name 'SchUseStrongCrypto' -Value '1' -Type Dword

	4. Sets Strong cryptography on 32 bit .net framework

		Set-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\.NetFramework\v4.0.30319' -Name 'SchUseStrongCrypto' -Value '1' -Type Dword

	5. Check Security protocols again and you should see tls 1.1 and 1.2 now

		[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol

	6. Installs the NuGet module needed to install other modules

		Install-Module PowershellGet -Force

	7. Now try to install your module again and it should be successful

If you are still having issues with errors stating you do not have permissions to run scripts on this system try the following

		Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process

Then try to run your Install-Module again, this will probably have you install the latest version of NuGet as well
